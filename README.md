# X Days Of Cloud Challenge

Welcome to my X days of Cloud Challenges!

I'm committed one hour, every day, for the next X days for cloud related works. X days means ==> this is a life time commitment.

## My Rules

1. I will push my works to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.

2. I will update my [Activity Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
