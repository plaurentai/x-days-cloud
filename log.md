# AWS Cloud Engineer

I am a self learner. I believe the best way to learn anything is to do it. Do it with passion and do it consistently everyday. This page shows my learning and experience with AWS cloud technologies. The learning will concentrate on the architecture part of AWS. I am using python and related technologies to automate everything that can be automated. Everything will documented for others to learn. Learning to teach will make you smarter.
