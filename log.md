# AWS Cloud Engineer

I am a self learner. I believe the best way to learn anything is to do it. Do it with passion and do it consistently everyday. This page shows my learning and experience with AWS cloud technologies. The learning will concentrate on the architecture part of AWS. I am using python and related technologies to automate everything that can be automated. Everything will documented for others to learn. Learning to teach will make you smarter.

**Focus**: 

The focus was on understanding what cloud computing is all about, AWS account, and **do it**.

**Progress**:

- Creating free-tier AWS account
- Leran the basics of cloud computing
- Learn about cloud deployment models
- Learn about the benefits of these models
- Learn about the shared responsibility model
- Understanding what AWS account is all about

**Thoughts**:

The lesson today was refreshing, especially the learning about AWS account. An AWS account is a container for identities and resources. Root user has access to everytging, while IAM users has access to only what they are allowed to.
